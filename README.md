## 🌟 Introduction
The chatbot is built to:
- Interpret user intents using **Dialogflow**.
- Respond to queries through a custom **FastAPI** backend.
- Make development and testing easier using **ngrok** for secure tunneling.

This project is ideal for developers looking to learn and build AI-powered conversational bots.

## ✨ Features
- Intent classification using **Dialogflow**.
- Dynamic response generation with **FastAPI**.
- Secure public endpoint creation using **ngrok**.
- Scalable, modular backend design.
- Real-time interaction with a chatbot interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Dialogflow**: For building conversational interfaces.
- **Python**: Backend development.
- **FastAPI**: RESTful API development.
- **ngrok**: Tunneling for local server exposure.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user intents and responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
1. **Dialogflow**: Handles intent recognition and conversation design.
2. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - Processes user input from Dialogflow.
   - Queries a database for relevant responses.
3. **ngrok**: Exposes the locally running FastAPI app for Dialogflow webhook integration.
